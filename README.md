## Built-in React Hooks:

> As of November 7, 2023, there are 15 built-in react hooks.

- State Hooks:
  - *State* let you "remmeber" information like input value or a selected image index. To add state to a componenet we can use one of these Hooks:
    - useState: declares a state variable that you can update directly.
    - useReducer: declares a state variable with the _update logic_ inside a reducer function.
